                        <h2>Part 1: THE YOUNG ONE</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Seven-year-old Mira Ram knows exactly how to define good and bad people. A good person, she says, is someone who isn’t a bully. They aren’t rude, they pay attention in school and they study at home. From there, it’s quite simple for her to define a bad person.
                            <br>
                            <br> “Someone who's a bully, and is rude and doesn’t pay attention — basically the opposite of a good person,” Ram said.
                            <br>
                            <br> As a third grader at Bluehills Elementary, her beliefs are strongly influenced by two things: her parents and her school.
                            <br>
                            <br> In the beginning of the year, police officers came to her school to give a presentation about bullies, and as she learned more about upstanders and bystanders, she began to believe that good people are upstanders.
                            <br>
                            <br> At home, her parents have instilled a strong belief in Ram about the benefits of studying. She wakes up at 6:30 a.m. every day to practice math in the morning, and believes that studying well will lead to a good life when she’s older.</p>
                        <img src="images/girl.gif" alt="Girl">
                        <p>As for her other beliefs, the first thing that came to her was her belief in God. With parents whose physical lives are deeply intertwined with their spiritual ones, Ram’s faith in God has never wavered in her seven years of life.
                            <br>
                            <br> “I believe that God keeps us alive,” Ram said.
                            <br>
                            <br> Ram believes that she learns from her experiences and the people she meets. As she grows older, she says her beliefs will change as she experiences different things and more people come into and out of her life. Her parents and little brother, two constants in her life thus far, have shaped her beliefs about both religion and morality.
                            <br>
                            <br> “I lied once,” Ram said. “And I got in big trouble, so I believe I shouldn’t do that anymore. I didn’t like potatoes [so] when no one was looking I put it on my brother’s plate, [but] somehow my mom found out, and she gave me a big talk.”
                            <br>
                            <br> Although Ram agrees that her beliefs are strongly influenced by her parents and her school, she also knows that her beliefs are her own. Her experiences and the people she meets are different from her parents, and therefore make her beliefs unique.
                            <br>
                            <br> “We’re different people, even though we’re a family,” Ram said.
                            <br>

                        <h2>Part 2: THE MIDDLE-ER ONE</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Freshman Andrew Chang’s beliefs have changed as he has matured through middle school and into high school and has seen a change in his relationships .
                            <br>
                            <br> As high school can be a place of gossip and judgement, Chang believes that people’s character and nature may change because of how they want to be perceived in school. Because of this, Chang thinks it’s harder to make friendships that won’t break easily.
                            <br>
                            <br> “As people grow their personality may also change,” Chang said. “They could become more self-centered or want to isolate themselves from others or they could be a really big show off and try to get as many [friends] as they can but in a really unnatural way.”</p>
                        <img src="images/boy.gif" alt="Boy">
                        <p>While their personality can change, so can their beliefs. As kids grow up, the rise of differences in beliefs and morals can sometimes create a rift in friendships. Chang has experienced this himself recently, when he got into an argument, about personal reasons, with his friends on something that they completely disagreed about because of their morals and beliefs. The friends haven’t spoken in two weeks and even now, Chang doesn’t want to associate with them.
                            <br>
                            <br> “Everything went way beyond what we expected it to be,” Chang said, “and it got to a point where we didn’t want to talk to each other anymore and we like ‘ ya we’re done.’”
                            <br>
                            <br> While Chang doesn’t agree with them, he doesn’t necessarily think they’re bad people, but rather he doesn’t care for them as much. He defines bad people as unapproachable and unwilling to help out, while he describes good people as the exact opposite, as someone who can be a close friend, a person with similar beliefs, but not automatically a best friend. However when he was younger, he thought about the world much more differently.
                            <br>
                            <br> “I never had any thoughts about anybody in elementary school,” Chang said. “I thought everyone could be friends, but now because of the way that stereotypes, and all these rumors that go around school, your relationship with other[s] changes really fast.”

                        <h2>Part 3: THE OLD ONE</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Seventy-five-year-old Betty Burchard believes that defining a good person and a bad person isn’t exactly black and white. But throughout her life, she’s always admired those who have strong beliefs and stick to them.
                            <br>
                            <br> “I tend to be inspired by people who have strong constitutions and who can stand up to adversity,” Burchard said. “That’s something I don't do real well — I shrink from it.”
                            <br>
                            <br> Yet through her lifetime, Burchard has learned that she is stronger than she thought she was.
                            <br>
                            <br> Growing up in Texas, Burchard’s beliefs were shaped by her environment. Her family had an African-American maid, and she was partly raised by an African-American woman. She didn’t really know that there were beliefs involved, nor did she have any strong beliefs about it. It was just how her life was.
                            <br>
                            <br> “My mother got upset one time because I would run to [the caretaker] rather than my mother,” Burchard said. “My mother was having her take care of me, that's who I was closer to. I never thought one way about it, I just didn't.”
                            <br>
                            <br> By the time she started high school in 1955, her high school was integrated, but the movie theaters were still segregated. Burchard describes how African Americans would have to sit separately in the balcony area. But as exchange students began coming to the nearby University of Texas at Austin, there was the question of whether the students would have to sit in the balcony because they were black. Burchard describes the resulting rule as somewhat strange.
                            <br>
                            <br> “If you went into a theater and you were black and you could prove you were not an American citizen, that you were an exchange student, you could sit down with all the other people,” Burchard said. “If you're an American citizen and you're black, you had to sit in the balcony.”
                            <br>
                            <br> The first time Burchard saw an African-American at a party in a room full of caucasians, she remembered being surprised. Now, she can’t imagine it being any other way.</p>
							<img src="images/woman.gif" alt="Woman">
                            <p>“There's no way I would ever think African Americans should be different from anyone else now, and I think much of it is because I’ve been living in California, where that's the attitude,” Burchard said.
                            <br>
                            <br> Just as her environment has shaped her beliefs, her parents did back then too. In high school, Burchard never really had her own game plan. Her beliefs were shaped by her parents, and her goals were just to get by in school and then go to college — she knew college was part of her parents’ plan.
                            <br>
                            <br> “I just went along with the program that was set up for me,” Burchard said.
                            <br>
                            <br> Mount Holyoke College, a liberal arts college in Massachusetts, was the only school she applied to, and Burchard received a rejection letter. Although college may have been part of her parents’ plan for her, Burchard was still disappointed.
                            <br>
                            <br> “I never put together [that] I had to really work hard to get to that goal [of going to Mount Holyoke,]” Burchard said. “But it was sort of a vague goal to me; it was one of my parent’s goals.”
                            <br>
                            <br> Burchard would then go on to another liberal arts college in Massachusetts, Pine Manor, since her parents wanted her to have an education on the East Coast. The school officials had managed to reassure her parents that she could attend Pine Manor for two years, and then transfer to Mount Holyoke. It’s a plan that Burchard thinks could’ve worked, save for the fact that she didn’t like it there.
                            <br>
                            <br> Defying her parents’ plan, Burchard went back home to the University of Texas at Austin, where she studied english, economics and education. It was the first time she’d establish her own concrete goals.
                            <br>
                            <br> She found herself in Southern California for a teaching job that lasted a year, and then went back to Texas. During that time, she’d spend her summers in Hawaii, before deciding to stay to get her doctorate degree at the University of Hawaii.
                            <br>
                            <br> “I would've stayed in Hawaii forever if I hadn't been married and my husband was transferred here,” Burchard said. “I loved Hawaii.”
                            <br>
                            <br> But Burchard did get married, which brought her here in 1974 — Los Altos Hills, California.
                            <br>
                            <br> Here, she taught at Pinewood High School in Los Altos for six years, and then Lincoln High School in San Jose for 11 years before retiring. Then, she taught student teachers at San Jose State University. She retired again when she felt that she could no longer keep up with the technology, but now she’s back to working with student teachers again at SJSU.
                            <br>
                            <br> Along the way, she’d gotten a divorce from her husband and moved to Cupertino — she’s been living here for 23 years. Burchard said that she needed the divorce since the marriage was not a positive one, but it was still hard for her. Yet through that, she’s figured out that she’s stronger than she originally thought.
                            <br>
                            <br> “I see myself as an enabler … I kept thinking he would get his act together and I enabled him because I kept providing all the finances and whatever,” Burchard said. “I am very sensitive about that kind of thing now. [I] won’t let myself do that anymore.”
                            <br>
                            <br> But she is still glad she was able to have two sons. Both of them are in their 40s, and married with kids of their own now. Motherhood is one of Burchard’s proudest achievements. She said that much of her values came from her parents, and that it’s nice to see those values reflected in her own children.
                            <br>
                            <br> “I just don't think you can do a better thing,” Burchard said. “Somehow, to me, being president of the U.S. — especially with this president — pales to me in terms of having kids and doing what you can to make them good people.”
                            <br>
                            <br> Burchard said that she has a tendency to second guess herself. At times, she even wonders whether she should’ve bought a house in Los Gatos instead of Cupertino, where the monetary profit would’ve been greater. But in the long run, she believes that some things are more important than money. She knows that it’s more about being where she’s happy — and she’s happy here in Cupertino. And looking back, she’s not sure she would tell herself not to do the things she’s done.
                            <br>
                            <br> “I think all of those things are growing experiences, so I’m not sure I would tell myself not to do them,” Burchard said. “I do think over the years I’ve figured out I was stronger than I thought I was — a divorce was hard for me — but I got through it and you know, and I did okay. I’m still here, so I would tell myself ‘you're strong even though you've had your setbacks. You're strong, and you can get through this.’”
